// The key objective of the Factory Method is extensibility. Factory Methods are frequently 
// used in applications that manage, maintain, or manipulate collections of objects that are 
// different but at the same time have many characteristics (i.e. methods and properties) in 
// common. An example would be a collection of documents with a mix of Xml documents, Pdf documents, 
// and Rtf documents.
